When you go to /:id

Step 1) Check if password corresponding to /:id is stored in Internal Storage.

Step 2) if(passowrd){
		Goto step 3
	}
	else{
		Ask to enter the password and goto Step 3
	}
Step 3) 
	 -> Make a get request to /:id that gets the encrypted data from the server
	 -> if there is no data in the server, store the password in the internal storage and make a new entry and start typing 

	 -> if there is data in the server, Try to decrypt that data with the help of the password
	 -> if(Decrypted) store the password in Internal Storage and start typing
	 -> if(not decrypted) display error
